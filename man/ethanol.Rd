\usage{data(ethanol)}
\description{
The ethanol data frame contains 88 sets of measurements for variables
from an experiment in which ethanol was burned in a
single cylinder automobile test engine.

This data set was part of the package SemiPar, which is no longer available 
at CRAN in compiled form. Copied to JOPS with slight modifications of the documentation.

\format{
  This data frame contains the following columns:
  \describe{
    \item{NOx}{the concentration of nitric oxide (NO) and 
               nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in engine exhaust, 
               normalized by the work done by the engine.}
    \item{C}{the compression ratio of the engine}
    \item{E}{the equivalence ratio at which the engine was run --
             a measure of the richness of the air/ethanol mix.}
  }
